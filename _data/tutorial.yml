      Logging roads are a major indicator of deforestation in the Congo Basin . Until now, their reach has been difficult to visualize, obscuring the rapid rise in deforestation in the region. Often, these roads are discovered only after they have been abandoned.

      Together, the [World Resources Institute](http://wri.org) and [Moabi](http://rdc.moabi.org) are analyzing over a decade of imagery to track rainforest logging road activity.

      Sounds good?  Let’s get started.
