# Editing

All logging road data are stored in OpenStreetMap, a global dataset of geographic data fully managed by crowd-based edits.  In order to contribute, please [sign up](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) for an OSM account.

Contributions to the project are managed within the [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/about).  To contribute, click on a country at the bottom of the page to navigate to that country’s map in the Tasking Manager.  Developed to manage large mapping projects across wide contributor base, the Tasking Manager divides each countr’s area of interest into square task grid cells.

Clear tasks are empty, yellow tasks have been completed, and green tasks have been validated.  Task cells outlined in orange are locked and currently being edited by another contributor.

Click on one task and choose Start Mapping to lock that task and start editing.  If you have not yet created an account with OpenStreetMap or are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so.

# Opening a Task

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/1.%20Start%20Mapping%20Page.PNG?raw=true" alt="Select a Country" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
From the bottom of the homepage, select the country in which you would like to begin mapping. This will take you to a separate page housing the HOT Tasking Manager. Here you can select a task to contribute to, see editing history, and view progress statistics. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/2.%20HOT%20TM.PNG?raw=true" alt="HOT TM" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
Once in the Tasking Manager, select a grid cell in the map window and click “Start Mapping”. If you are not already logged into your OSM account, you will be prompted to either log in to your existing account or to create an account on the OSM website. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/3.%20Selecting%20iD%20in%20TM.PNG?raw=true" alt="Select a Task" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
Then, within the “Edit with” drop-down menu, select “iD editor”. This will open the in-browser editor for OpenStreetMap in a separate tab, automatically centered on the task you selected. You are now ready to begin mapping.
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

# Understanding the iD Editor

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/Updated%20Toggling%20Roads.PNG?raw=true" alt="Toggling Roads" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
Once in the iD Editor, the area that you selected will be outlined by a purple rectangle, and as you zoom further into the area features should start to appear. Features on the map (things like roads, buildings, rivers, etc.) can be toggled on and off in the “Map Data” tool found on the right side of the screen (shortcut key: F). Most logging roads, if tagged correctly, will fall under the “Minor Roads” category, and can be toggled on and off under the “Map Features” drop-down.
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/5.%20Toggling%20Imagery.PNG?raw=true" alt="Imagery Options" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
The background imagery can also be toggled on and off in the “Background Settings” tab (shortcut key: B). You can toggle through 15 years of Landsat imagery in addition to current hi-res satellite imagery from MapBox, as well as adjust the brightness of the imagery. If you want to see just logging roads, you can click the “Logging Roads” box near the bottom of the menu. This limits the roads that show up to just those with the “Highway:track” tag, but more on that later. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/6.%20The%20Editing%20Tools.PNG?raw=true" alt="Editing Tools" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
Tools for drawing new features are found at the top of the map viewer, and their associated tags will appear in the box on the left side of the screen.
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

# Editing in iD

<p>You can edit already existing features in iD simply by double-clicking on them. Most likely the majority of the editing will be done by adding and moving around nodes associated with the roads. When you click on a node to begin editing you can do three things:

<ul>
    <li>You can expand the way by adding nodes to the end (shortcut key: A)</li>
    <li>By double-clicking you can add a node to the middle of a way</li>
    <li>You can move nodes around by clicking on them and then dragging them into position</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To stop editing nodes, simply double-click the node, or deselect it by clicking away from it. The US State Department has made a great guide for basic editing in iD, and you can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/Ir-3K0pjwOI">here</a>.</p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/7.%20Basic%20Tags.PNG?raw=true" alt="Basic Tags" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
That is how you edit geometry. To edit the metadata, or tags, begin by clicking on the way you are interested in editing. This will bring up the tag editing on the left side of the screen. To add or edit tags, first expand the “all tags” menu. Here, you will see a list of all the tags associated with the way. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p>Every logging road should have the following tags:
<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/8.%20Up%20Close%20Tags%20.PNG?raw=true" alt="CLose Up Tags" id="screen1" class="social2"/>

<ul>
    <li>"Highway:track"</li>
    <li>"Access:forestry" f</li>
    <li>“Source: Landsat”</li>
    <li>“Start_Date: either before 2000 or the year it was first spotted”</li>
</ul></p>

<p>(You can add new tags by selecting the plus-sign icon at the bottom of the tag list)</p>

<p>The “Start_Date” tag can be established by using the annual UMD Landsat imagery in the “Background Settings” tab, and finding in what year the road first appeared and selected from the list of years in the tags window. Selecting a year will auto-populate the “start_date” tag below.</p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/9.%20Abandoned%20Road%20Tags.PNG?raw=true" alt="Abandoned Tag" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
For roads that are abandoned, or no longer in use, use the tag “Abandoned:Highway: track” in place of the “Highway: track” tag. If you can see that a road is no longer in use (perhaps it is faint, or being covered by new growth), label it as such and add the “End_Date” tag that follows the same guide as the “Start_Date” tag.
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p>And that’s it! If you see roads that are not in OSM, feel free to add them, just remember to give them appropriate tags. It is important to remember that Your edits will not appear on OSM unless you save and upload them using the “Save” button at the top of the map viewer. This will show you all of the changes you made, and allow your edits to show up on the Logging Roads leaderboard.

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/10.%20comments.PNG?raw=true" alt="Comments" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
If you made any changes to the data (drew new roads, edited current roads, or even just corrected some tags) you need to leave a comment in the Tasking Manager. This allows those validating your work to know if there are any special circumstance about the area in question. This comment should include the hashtag #OSMloggingroads, so that we associate the editing you are doing with the project. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p>Once you are finished making edits, and have saved, you can close the iD editor, and click “Mark task as done” in the tasking manager. This unlocks the task, and will allows others to validate your work.</p>

# Tips for Interpreting the Imagery

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" img src="broken png" alt="Tips" id="screen1" class="social2"/>
We have chosen imagery that we believe best shows the contrast between roads and the surrounding vegetation. Roads will often appear in brighter tones ranging from yellow to blue, and surrounding vegetation will often show up as a dull or burnt orange. 
<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p>Aside from color, logging roads are distinguished from primary roads and other highways by their tendency to dead-end in forested areas. Some may appear grid-like and uniform, while others may be meandering, but generally they will diverge from more defined roads and abruptly end in the forest.</p>

<p>If you are not able to confirm whether or not there is a road present, air on the side of caution and do not add anything. As the project progress, more imagery may become available, and the ability to map hitherto questionable roads will increase.</p>
