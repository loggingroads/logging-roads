  <h1>How to Contribute to the Logging Roads Initiative</h1>
  
  <p>All logging road data are stored in OpenStreetMap, a global dataset of geographic data fully managed by crowd-based edits.  In order to contribute, please <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new" target="_blank">sign up</a> for an OSM account.</p>
  
  <p>Contributions to the project are managed within the <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/about" target="_blank">HOT Tasking Manager</a>. Developed to manage large mapping projects across wide contributor base, the Tasking Manager divides each country's area of interest into square task grid cells.</p>
  
  <p>iD, the in-browser editor for OpenStreetMap, is the editor of choice for the project data. iD is a polished, easy to learn, and no previous mapping experience is required to contribute.</p>
  
  <p>We have customized our own version of the iD editor for OpenStreetMap, tailored specifically to the Logging Roads Initiative. The guide below will take you through all the steps in contributing to the project, no previous experience needed. </p>
  
  
  <h1>Opening a Task</h1>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/1.%20Start%20Mapping%20Page.PNG?raw=true" alt="Select a Country"/>
    <p>From the bottom of the homepage, select the country in which you would like to begin mapping. This will take you to a the HOT Tasking Manager project for that country, where you can select a task to contribute to, see editing history, and view progress statistics.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/2.%20HOT%20TM.PNG?raw=true" alt="HOT TM"/>
    <p>In the Tasking Manager, select a grid cell in the map window and click “Start Mapping”. If you are not already logged into your OSM account, you will be prompted to either log in to your existing account or to create an account on the OSM website. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/3.%20Selecting%20iD%20in%20TM.PNG?raw=true" alt="Select a Task"/>
    <p>Within the “Edit with” drop-down menu, select “iD editor”. This will open the in-browser editor for OpenStreetMap, automatically centered on the task you selected. You are now ready to begin mapping.</p>
  </div>
  
  
  <h1>Understanding the iD Editor</h1>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/Updated%20Toggling%20Roads.PNG?raw=true" alt="Toggling Roads"/>
    <p>Once in the iD Editor, the area that you selected will be outlined by a purple rectangle.  Zoom in to view map features.</p>

    <p>Each features on the map (for example a road, building, or river) can be hidden using the filter tool in the <strong>Map Data Pane</strong> (shortcut key: F). Click <strong>Logging Road</strong> to hide all logging roads, and click <strong>Other Features</strong> to hide all additional features.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/5.%20Toggling%20Imagery.PNG?raw=true" alt="Imagery Options"/>
    <p>Change background imagery in the <strong>Layers Pane</strong> (shortcut key: B). The project has 14 years of false-color Landsat imagery that are processed to accentuate disturbances to forest cover.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/6.%20The%20Editing%20Tools.PNG?raw=true" alt="Editing Tools"/>
    <p>Tools for drawing new features are found at the top of the map viewer, and their associated tags will appear in the box on the left side of the screen.</p>
  </div>
  
  
  <h1>Editing in iD</h1>
  
  <p>Click on an existing feature in iD to edit it.  There are three ways to edit logging roads:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Extend the road by adding additional nodes to the end (shortcut key: A)</li>
    <li>Double-click the middle of a road to add a new node</li>
    <li>Move existing nodes by clicking on them and dragging them into position</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To stop editing, simply double-click the node, or deselect it by clicking away from it. The US State Department has made a great guide for basic editing in iD; find it <a href="https://youtu.be/Ir-3K0pjwOI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <!-- <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/7.%20Basic%20Tags.PNG?raw=true" alt="Basic Tags"/> -->
    <p>To edit feature attributes, click on the road you are interested in editing and select the year it is first visible to satellite imagery.</p>
  </div>
  
<!--   <div class="clearfix">
    <p>Every logging road should have the following tags:</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/8.%20Up%20Close%20Tags%20.PNG?raw=true" alt="CLose Up Tags"/>
  </div>
  
  <ul>
    <li>"Highway:track"</li>
    <li>"Access:forestry"</li>
    <li>“Source: Landsat”</li>
    <li>“Start_Date: either before 2000 or the year it was first spotted”</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>(You can add new tags by selecting the plus-sign icon at the bottom of the tag list)</p>
  
  <p>The “Start_Date” tag can be established by using the annual UMD Landsat imagery in the “Background Settings” tab, and finding in what year the road first appeared and selected from the list of years in the tags window. Selecting a year will auto-populate the “start_date” tag below.</p> -->
  
  
<!--   <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/9.%20Abandoned%20Road%20Tags.PNG?raw=true" alt="Abandoned Tag"/>
    <p>For roads that are abandoned, or no longer in use, use the tag “Abandoned:Highway: track” in place of the “Highway: track” tag. If you can see that a road is no longer in use (perhaps it is faint, or being covered by new growth), label it as such and add the “End_Date” tag that follows the same guide as the “Start_Date” tag.</p>
  </div> -->
  
  <p>And that’s it! If you see roads that are not in OSM, feel free to add them, just remember to give them appropriate tags. It is important to remember that your edits will not appear on OSM unless you save and upload them using the “Save” button at the top of the map viewer. This will show you all of the changes you made, and allow your edits to show up on the Logging Roads leaderboard.</p>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/10.%20comments.PNG?raw=true" alt="Comments"/>
    <p>If you made any changes to the data (drew new roads, edited current roads, or even just corrected some tags) you need to leave a comment in the Tasking Manager. This allows those validating your work to know if there are any special circumstance about the area in question. This comment should include the hashtag #OSMloggingroads, so that we associate the editing you are doing with the project. </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Once you are finished making edits, and have saved, you can close the iD editor, and click “Mark task as done” in the tasking manager. This unlocks the task, and will allows others to validate your work.</p>
  

  <h1>Tips for Interpreting the Imagery</h1>
  
  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="https://github.com/crowdcover/logging-roads/blob/gh-pages/img/Road%20example.PNG?raw=true" alt="Tips"/>
    <p>We have chosen imagery that we believe best shows the contrast between roads and the surrounding vegetation. Roads will often appear in brighter tones ranging from yellow to blue, and surrounding vegetation will often show up as a dull or burnt orange. </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Aside from color, logging roads are distinguished from primary roads and other highways by their tendency to dead-end in forested areas. Some may appear grid-like and uniform, while others may be meandering, but generally they will diverge from more defined roads and end abruptly in the forest.</p>
  
  <p>If you are not able to confirm whether or not there is a road present, air on the side of caution and do not add anything. As the project progress, more imagery may become available, and the ability to map hitherto questionable roads will increase.</p>
