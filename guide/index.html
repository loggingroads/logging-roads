# Editing

All logging road data are stored in OpenStreetMap, a global dataset of geographic data fully managed by crowd-based edits.  In order to contribute, please [sign up](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) for an OSM account.

Contributions to the project are managed within the [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/about).  To contribute, click on a country at the bottom of the page to navigate to that country’s map in the Tasking Manager.  Developed to manage large mapping projects across wide contributor base, the Tasking Manager divides each countr’s area of interest into square task grid cells.

Clear tasks are empty, yellow tasks have been completed, and green tasks have been validated.  Task cells outlined in orange are locked and currently being edited by another contributor.

Click on one task and choose Start Mapping to lock that task and start editing.  If you have not yet created an account with OpenStreetMap or are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so.
